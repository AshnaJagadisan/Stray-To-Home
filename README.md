In Stray to Home, Mittens is a stray cat looking for a home. Users have 3 lives to collect enough fish and yarn while avoiding rotten apples and dogs. The difficulty increases with each level as items fall at a faster rate. If a user exhausts their lives, a maze can be completed to restore one more. Complete all levels to help Mittens find a home!
